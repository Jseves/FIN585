    "In this problem set you test the CAPM using a cross-sectional framework. Specifically, you test whether the CAPM holds using the Fama-MacBeth (1973) methodology. Before proceeding you need the datafile for this assignment. It's on Learning Suite ('mstk_fm_29-63.csv') or you can download it directly via this link: [Month Stock file: 29-63](http://diether.org/prephd/11-mstk_fm_29-63.csv). The data are a panel with returns from February 1929 to June of 1963 for all stocks common stocks on CRSP during the period:\n",

    "1. I want you to test the CAPM by estimating Fama-MacBeth regressions of the following form: \n",

    "r_{it} &= \\gamma_{0t} + \\gamma_{1t}\\hat{\\beta}_{it} + \\gamma_{2t}log(ME_{i,t-1})\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Explain how estimating these Fama-MacBeth regressions is a test of the CAPM. `Pandas` does *not* have a built in Fama-MacBeth function. However, the Fin 585 Library does have a Fama MacBeth regression function: [Fama MacBeth Docs](https://fin-library.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fama_macbeth.html). Use it to estimate the regression above.\n",

    "2. Based on your results in question (2), can you reject the CAPM? Explain. \n",

    "3. This time I want you to estimate Fama-MacBeth regressions of the following form: \n",

    "r_{it} = \\gamma_{0t} + \\gamma_{1t}\\hat{\\beta}_{it} + \\nu_{it}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Report the results of your Fama-MacBeth regressions in a table (it should include standard errors and t-statistics).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Based on your results in question (4), can you reject the CAPM? Explain. Is it even possible to ever reject the CAPM with a regression specification like the one you used in question (4)?"
